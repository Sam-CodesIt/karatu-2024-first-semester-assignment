        <h2><span class="emoji">üìñ</span>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Greetings! I'm Samuel Onyeji, an aspiring frontend engineer currently
          enrolled in AltSchool Africa 12-month diploma program in Frontend
          Engineering program. My student ID is
          <strong>ALT/SOE/O24/0140</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to work as an AI engineer or
          developer, who designs and implements AI systems and applications
          across various industries. To achieve this, I'm aiming to pursue a
          Master's degree in Computer Science with specialization in Artificial
          Intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of academia and work, I enjoy sharing knowledge and assisting
          others on subjects of common interest. When I'm not engaged in
          intellectual pursuits or coding, you'll likely find me immersed in the
          world of football, listening to music or enjoying a good movie.
        </p>

        <p>
          I chose AltSchool Africa for its innovative approach to tech education
          and its focus on practical, industry-relevant skills. The School of
          Engineering's Frontend Engineering program caught my eye because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It offers hands-on projects that simulate real-world scenarios.
          </li>
          <li>
            The curriculum is up-to-date with the latest frontend technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are opportunities to collaborate with peers and industry
            professionals.
